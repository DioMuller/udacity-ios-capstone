# Udacity iOS Nanodegree Capstone project.

This is the repository for my final project for [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com)

## Description
This is the repository for all my tests and ideas for Udacity's capstone project, and, eventually, the final project itself.

## Environment

Since technology is ever evolving, and Apple updates it's development environment yearly, deprecating features and updating languages fast, I cannot guarantee for how long this code will continue working. This app was created with the following environment in mind:

* OSX Mojave
* XCode 10
* Swift 4.2
* iOS 12

While backwards compatibility and automatic conversion may work for future versions, there may be errors and inconsistencies.

### Cocoa Pods

This project may use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) for it's dependencies. To initalize the project you should first install CocoaPods and then initialize the dependencies by running

> pod install

After that, open the project using the Itch.xcworkspace created by CocoaPods.

## Task List

The Tasks, Issues and Enhancements for this app are listed on Github:

* [Task List](https://github.com/DioMuller/udacity-ios-itch/projects/1)
* [Issues](https://github.com/DioMuller/udacity-ios-itch/issues)

## Limitations
Unfortunately, I could not test any features that require a physical device, like the camera functionality, since I don't have an Apple developer subscription.
