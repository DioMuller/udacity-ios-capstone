# Itch.io iOS Client

This is the repository for my final project for [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com)

## Description
Itch is a client for itch.io on iOS.

## Environment
Since technology is ever evolving, and Apple updates it's development environment yearly, deprecating features and updating languages fast, I cannot guarantee for how long this code will continue working. This app was created with the following environment in mind:

* OSX Mojave
* XCode 10
* Swift 4.2
* iOS 12

While backwards compatibility and automatic conversion may work for future versions, there may be errors and inconsistencies.

## To Do

Version 1.0.

### Basic Features:

#### User:
* `TODO` Implement OAuth 2.0 login.
* `TODO` Get User Credential Info.
* `TODO` Get User Profile Data.
* `TODO` Get the user's game list.

#### Games:
* `TODO` List newest games.

#### Technical:
* `TODO` Create OAuth 2.0 lib.
* `TODO` Create Network Layer.
* `TODO` Create Models
* `TODO` Create JSON (for user info) and XML (for game info) interpreter.
* `TODO` Create Core Data layer to cache last results, so the user has some data even if offline.

### Extra Features:

* `TODO` Limit options depending on.
* `TODO` List user download keys for a game.
* `TODO` Get the user's punchases list for a game.

* `TODO` Games Filtering/Searching.

### Bugs and Enhancements

Nothing here yet.

## Limitations
Unfortunately, I could not test any features that require a physical device, like the camera functionality, since I don't have an Apple developer subscription.
